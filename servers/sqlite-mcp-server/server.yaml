  description: The SQLite MCP Server transforms SQLite into a powerful, AI-ready database engine. It combines standard relational operations with advanced analytics, text and vector search, geospatial capabilities, and intelligent workflow automation. By layering business intelligence tools, semantic resources, and guided prompts on top of SQLite, it enables both developers and AI assistants to interact with data more naturally and effectively.
